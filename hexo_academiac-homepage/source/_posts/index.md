**Research Interests**

- <details><summary>Distributed estimation for large-scale interconnected systems</summary>
&nbsp With the great development of communication and sensor technology, the systems we seek to design and control have become increasingly large-scale. To simplify the analysis of large-scale systems, various system decomposition techniques are used to divide the overall system into interconnected subsystems with lower dimensions and overlapping states. Distributed estimation for large-scale interconnected systems is an important theoretical issue in systems and control. However, most of the existing work does not take into account the overlap of system states, which contains redundant information that can be used to further improve the estimation performance.

- <details> <summary>Secure estimation for large-scale interconnected systems</summary>
&nbsp The monitoring for the large-scale system is of significant importance, while the communication and computation constraints for subsystems make it difficult to achieve satisfactory estimation performance. Furthermore, with the fusion of cyber into physical processes, the system is more vulnerable to malicious attacks which do exist and happen during routine operations. However, the detection of various types of attacks within an acceptable time is not reasonable for energy-constrained subsystems. Therefore, how to design a resilient estimator for large-scale interconnected systems to mitigate the influence of cyber attacks is theoretically and practically meaningful.

- <details> <summary>Distributed fusion estimation for binary sensor systems</summary>
&nbsp Binary sensors compress the measurement information into two possible values as outputs and have been commonly employed in many practical applications including environmental awareness, medical monitoring and localization. There are two most important advantages that make binary sensors potential to replace traditional sensors in some cases. They are firstly cost-effective, which means numerous binary sensors can be deployed to achieve acceptable performance at a low cost. Meanwhile, the communication cost of binary sensors is minimal since each sensor only transmits one bit of information at each time. The bandwidth constraint problem, in this sense, can be avoided naturally in network communication environments by using binary sensors. Therefore, we shall study the distributed fusion estimation problem under binary sensors.
